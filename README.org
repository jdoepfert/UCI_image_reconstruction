* Ultrafast CEST Imaging (UCI) image reconstruction for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)


Matlab implementation of the algorithm for reconstructing images from highly
undersampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data as described in
detail in [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24721681][this publication]].

** Run script
To reproduce the figures from the above publication, simply run the script =MAIN_script.m=. 

The code uses Jeffrey Fessler's image reconstruction toolbox
(http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/) for the nonuniform FFT
computation (NUFFT).

** Algorithm outline
The image reconstruction problem in MRI can be described as


*A* (*X*) = *Y* 


where *Y*  is the measured undersampled /k/-space data,
*X* is the (unknown) full image series (in real space) to be
reconstructed, and *A* is a linear operator consisting of
the calculation of the Fourier transform (FT) of *X* and the
subsequent evaluation at the /k/-space trajectory's positions. Since
the data is sub-sampled, *Y* is usually smaller than
*X*, making the problem ill-posed and not solvable by simply
inverting the reconstruction problem.
Instead, we try to estimate *X* in an iterative fashion by
applying the following prior knowledge: 

+ We assume that the CEST image series *X* can be
  approximated by a low-rank matrix (see e.g. [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1773][this paper]])
+ We drive the solution *X* towards zero in areas where no sample is present (limited object support (LS), see for example [[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.20285/full][this paper]])
 
The following pseudo-code outlines the algorithm.
